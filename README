Audio-AMaMP version 0.01
========================

This module provides a Perl language binding for the AMaMP core. AMaMP
is a cross-platform audio engine, and more details can be found at
http://amamp.sourceforge.net/. This module provides an OO interface
that enables you to start the core and exchange messages with it.

This is a Perl XS module in part, and is known to compile on Win32 as
well as a range of POSIX-compliant platforms.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you get compile errors on Win32, it is most likely that the WIN32
conditional compilement variable is not being set. You may need to
modify the generated makefile to install it; please notify the the
AMaMP project and send details of your compiler if this is the case.
These reports can be sent to the AMaMP Development mailing list at
amamp-development@lists.sourceforge.net. Reports of all other
problems are also welcome and encouraged, particularly if you send
a patch. ;-)

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires a C compiler to install. To make use of it, you
will need to have installed the AMaMP Core, however the core itself
is not required to install the module.
